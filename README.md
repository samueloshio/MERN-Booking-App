## 💪 Motivation

This is a simple yet robust Onine Booking App created on MERN Stack flow. The purpose of this project is not to operate an online booking, but to create a template for interested individuals. Thus, the App can be easily created by forking and modifying this template. This will be beneficial for us to support in development speed for individuals and startup alike. We can only succeed in the world by coming from different areas and joining our forces.
